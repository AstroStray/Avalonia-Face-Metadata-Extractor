## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability within MetaExtractor, please send an e-mail to the maintainers. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

**Contact:** Create a private security advisory through GitHub's security tab or contact the repository owner directly.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** assessment
4. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
5. **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment:** Within 1 week  
- **Status Update:** Every week until resolved
- **Resolution:** Depends on severity and complexity

### Security Best Practices

This project follows these security practices:

#### Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Automated security vulnerability scanning
- Review of all dependency updates before merging

#### Code Security
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- Input validation for all external data
- Secure handling of image/video files
- Memory management for OpenCV operations

#### Data Privacy
- Face detection data is processed locally
- No automatic data transmission to external services
- User controls over data retention and deletion
- Anonymization options for exported data

#### Build & Deployment
- Secure CI/CD pipeline with vulnerability scanning
- Code signing for releases (planned)
- Container security best practices (if applicable)

### Known Security Considerations

#### OpenCV Dependencies
- Uses OpenCV for computer vision operations
- Keep OpenCV libraries updated for security patches
- Validate input image/video formats

#### Model Files
- ONNX models should be verified and trusted sources only
- Implement model validation before loading
- Sandboxed model execution environment

#### User Data
- Face analysis results may contain sensitive biometric data
- Follow local privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Provide clear data handling disclosures

## Security Features

### Current Implementation
- âœ… Dependency vulnerability scanning
- âœ… Secret scanning prevention

## Compliance

### Privacy Regulations
- **GDPR Compliance**: User consent, data portability, right to deletion
- **CCPA Compliance**: User data rights and disclosure requirements
- **Biometric Laws**: Compliance with local biometric data regulations

### Security Standards
- Following OWASP secure coding practices
